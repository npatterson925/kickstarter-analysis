# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Crowdfunding campaign data for various theather productions containing funding goals, amount of pledged funds and their outcomes will be analized to determine whether there are specific factors that make a project's campaign successful.

### Purpose
Visualize theater plays campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges
  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Data was organized by the number of successful, failed and canceled therater outcomes based on the month the compaign was launched. There is a grand total for each month and each outcome overall. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Data was organized by the theater subcateogry of plays with outcomes based on a range of funding goals.  Total number of successful, failed and canceled funding goal amounts was converted into percentage rates. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not have any challenges producing this data but some difficulties that could be encountered are the misuse of formulas.  One wrong number or symbol could throw off the entire data set.  Copy and pasting can get tricky as excel tends to insert other cells a user might select.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
There is a higher success rate in the months of April, May, June, July.  January, February, March, September and December all had roughly the same nunmber of failed campaign launches.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The smaller the Goal amount, the higher the success rate.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There is a large gap between campaigns that had a goal greater than $25,000.  As a result the trending data tends to skew the result of successful vs failed campaigns.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could have used a cluster bar graph to show numbers by month for theater outcomes by launch date.  We could have used theater outcomes by theater type to see if other theater types were more sucessful.
